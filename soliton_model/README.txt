———————————————————————————————————————

The dynamics and motion of solitons are simulated by solving the equation of motion through numerical methods.
Particularly RK4 was used as it was stable.

———————————————————————————————————————

There are 7 python script files. They all contain roughly the same code, but they are differ
to produce the figures in the report. Most figures have been edited to provide more clarity in report.

For some files, many lines are commented to show the main algorithm of my code.

NOTE: the data in the stability table was recorded by running the 'single soliton.py' script
several times with different alpha, dt and h values.

File				What file used for
single soliton.py 		figure 2, where it shows properties of solitons
soliton velocity graph.py	figure 3, plots velocity against alpha
soliton collision.py		figure 4 left, produce results for a merging collision
soliton collision no merge.py	figure 4 right, produce results for a non-merging collision
wave break.py			figure 5, wave break visualisation
shock waves.py			figure 6A, shock waves
diffusion term.py		figure 6B, added diffusive term to reduce stability
