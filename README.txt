Scientific modelling

———————————————————————————————————————

Several models were developed to study the dynamics, motion and physics of them.

- satellite_model
	- Simulates the motion of a satellite orbiting a planet. Energies and motion are calculated.
	- Animation is included, showing movement in moving and inertial frames.

- plum_rutherford_model
	- Simulates the gold leaf experiment to confirm Rutherford's atomic model.
	- Alpha particles are deflected by gold atoms.

- raytracer
	- Traces the path of rays travelling through particular optical lenses.
	- The best focusing lens can be found with the code.

- single_double_pendulum_model
	- Simulates the motion of a single and double pendulum by solving equations of motion with finite difference methods.

- soliton_model
	- Simulates the physics of solitons, showing their unique properties with animations and calculations of their properties.
